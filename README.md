Something's missing ? [create Issues](https://github.com/BeardedBear/BeardedTheme/issues) so that I can make the theme as compatible as possible ! ❤️ ;)

## 🚀 Installation

- Open the Extensions sidebar in VS Code
- Search for `Bearded`
- Click Install
- Open the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P or ⇧⌘P
- Select Preferences: Color Theme and choose `Bearded Theme`.

## Bonus
VSCode now supports native bracket colorization without any extensions. Just add the following content to your `settings.json` file:

```json
"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
  "[*]": {
    "editorBracketHighlight.foreground1": "#D39E17",
    "editorBracketHighlight.foreground2": "#A15DEF",
    "editorBracketHighlight.foreground3": "#3398DB"
  }
 }
```
